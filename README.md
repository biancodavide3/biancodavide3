## Hi there 👋

🎓 I’m a **Computer Engineering student** at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it), passionate about building real-world, production-grade software.

📚 I continuously learn from top-tier online platforms such as:  
- [MITx](https://mitxonline.mit.edu) — deepening my understanding of computer science and AI fundamentals  
- [Amigoscode](https://www.amigoscode.com) — mastering modern backend development with Spring Boot and DevOps tools  
- [Code with Mosh](https://www.codewithmosh.com) — refining practical full-stack and software engineering skills  

🚀 My focus areas include:  
- **Backend & Cloud:** Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS  
- **Data & Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Python, from Linear Models to Deep Learning

💡 I enjoy working on **open-source and side projects** that turn ideas into code — from backend microservices to full-stack web applications — many of which you can find right here on my GitHub.

🌟 I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world IT projects, keep learning cutting-edge technologies, and grow as an engineer who bridges software and intelligence.
